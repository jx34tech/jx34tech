I am currently collaborating with another partner regarding an education startup that is working to provide better learning feedback to Students.

I am also currently personally working on a project involving machine learning and voice and speech pattern recognition involving Mobile Radio. If you work in this area, please reach out to me via my email, and I will gladly have a discussion to learn more.
